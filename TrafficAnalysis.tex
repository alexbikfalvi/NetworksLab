\section{Disable Your Local Firewall}

On a Windows machine, your local firewall can interfere with the assignment. Go to the \textbf{\sf Control Panel}, \textbf{\sf Windows Firewall} and from the left-hand site options list, select \textbf{\sf Turn Windows Firewall on or off}. In the page, select the option \textbf{\sf Turn off Windows Firewall (not recommended)} for both private and public networks, and then click \textbf{\sf OK}.

\section{Wireshark Network Analyzer}

Start your computer in Windows or Linux. Start the \emph{Wireshark} software program and choose the correct network interface from the \textbf{\sf Capture} \textgreater \textbf{\sf Interfaces} dialog. Use it to start the packet capture. It is also possible to configure the length of the capture and other details.

\begin{tabular}{>{\columncolor{tablegray}}p{15cm}}
\multicolumn{1}{>{\columncolor{tableorange}}l}{Questions \textbf{(6 $\times$ 1.6\,\%)}}\\
What is the source and destination IP address?\\
\hline
What are the source and destination MAC addresses?\\
\hline
What is the number of bytes in the packet?\\
\hline
What protocols can you see in the packet?\\
\hline
Did you capture an HTTP packet? If yes, what is the length of the HTTP message (that is payload of the TCP segment or segments)?\\
\hline
What are the source and destination port?\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

In the dialog \textbf{\sf Analyze} \textgreater \textbf{\sf Enable Protocols...} you can configure the protocols that Wireshark captures and displays. Looking at the default protocols, find at least one protocol of each of the four upper layers of the TCP/IP stack (application, transport, internet and link). Include a brief description of the protocols you found.

Select the menu \textbf{\sf Statistics} \textgreater \textbf{\sf Protocol Hierarchy} and observe the percentage of the following protocols: Ethernet, Internet Protocol, TCP, UDP, Logical Link Control, ARP, STP, IPv6, HTTP.

Repeat the previous capture using IPv6, by performing a ping to the local-link IPv6 address of a neighbor computer. Use the following command on a Windows computer:
\begin{lstlisting}
ping -6 <destination-address>
\end{lstlisting}

or the following command on a Linux computer:
\begin{lstlisting}
ping6 -I <interface> <destination-address>
\end{lstlisting}

What are the protocol differences between IPv4 and IPv6?\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)}

The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) resolves the association between an IP address and a MAC address. It is used in IP over Ethernet networks. Clear your ARP cache using one of the following commands. On a Windows computer use:

\begin{lstlisting}
arp -d
\end{lstlisting}
On a Linux computer use:

\begin{lstlisting}
sudo ip neigh flush all
\end{lstlisting}

Begin a new traffic capture and then ping or browse to any preferred destination. Analyze a pair of request-response ARP packet. You can filter the ARP packets by writing \texttt{\color{blue}ARP} in the \textbf{\sf Filter Toolbar}.

\begin{center}
\sffamily\small
\begin{tabular}{>{\columncolor{tablegray}}p{15cm}}
\multicolumn{1}{>{\columncolor{tableorange}}l}{Questions \textbf{(4 $\times$ 1.6\,\%)}}\\
What are the source and destination MAC addresses of the Ethernet frame that contains the ARP request message? The response should state in words the meaning of the MAC addresses, not their values.\\
\hline
What are the source and destination IP addresses in the ARP request and response frames? The response should state in words the meaning of the IP addresses, not their values.\\
\hline
What are the source and destination MAC addresses in the ARP request and response frames? The response should state in words the meaning of the MAC addresses, not their values.\\

\section{\texttt{tcpdump}}

In this section, we shall use the \texttt{\color{blue}tcpdump} command in Linux. Use:

\begin{lstlisting}
man tcpdump
\end{lstlisting}
to learn about the different parameters and options of this command. With \texttt{\color{blue}tcpdump} it is also possible to filter the traffic according to the source or destination addresses, protocol, port number, etc.

Open a terminal and begin a new \texttt{\color{blue}tcpdump} capture. Enter the \textbf{\sf Ctrl+C} keys to finish the capture.

\begin{center}

\end{center}

The first line of \texttt{tcpdump} specifies the network interface used during the capture. To change it, use the \texttt{\color{blue}-i} option.
